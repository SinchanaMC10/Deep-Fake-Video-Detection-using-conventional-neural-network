# Deep-Fake-Video-Detection-using-conventional-neural-network
In January 2018, a desktop application called FakeApp was launched, “Deepfake” word is 
the combination of “Deep learning” and “fake”, these are the AI generated videos in which a 
person in a video or image is replaced with someone else. The idea of swapping faces on photo is 
not new, we can find examples of such photos made in 19th century, back then these photos were 
made by hand. However, when the idea of neural networks became popular and with advancement 
in computational field, people began to use this technology to create such deepfake videos and 
images. Nowadays we can download and run such programs which can swap our face with others. 
Today, none of us will be surprised by apps like FaceApp, Snapchat that have an ability to swap 
faces with good quality and make us funny. 
His app allows users to easily create and share videos with their faces swapped with each other, 
after this app many such apps were launched like Face Swap, DeepFace Lab. Larger companies 
also started to use deepfakes. The Japanese AI company DataGrid made a full body deepfake that 
can create a person from scratch, they intend to use these for fashion and apparel. A mobile 
deepfake app, Impressions, was launched in March 2020. It was the first app for the creation of 
celebrity deepfake videos from mobile phones. Today we can find various desktop as well as 
mobile apps which we can use to create a good quality deepfake. 
The rise of deep fake technology represents one of the most significant challenges in the digital 
age, as it allows for the creation of highly realistic videos that can distort reality and manipulate 
perceptions. Deep fakes leverage advanced artificial intelligence techniques, particularly deep 
learning, to generate convincing images and sounds that can mislead audiences and undermine 
trust in visual media. With applications ranging from entertainment to misinformation campaigns, 
the implications of deep fakes are far-reaching, necessitating effective detection mechanisms to 
combat their spread. 
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has led to the 
emergence of sophisticated video manipulation techniques, commonly known as "deepfakes." 
These AI-generated videos can convincingly mimic real-world footage, allowing malicious actors 
to create fake content that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality. As a result, 
deepfakes pose a significant threat to authenticity, trust, and security, with far-reaching 
implications for individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.
